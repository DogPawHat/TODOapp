# TODO App
Basic To-Do list app written with Typescript and AngularJS. All data stored offline with Local Forage.

Branches:
gh-pages: actual deployed live site you can use at dogpawhat.github.io/TODOapp
master: live development
0.1-frodo: First very basic usable version of the site
0.2-samwell: Upgraded to be more in line with the Material design spec. Still very basic.

App is for demonstration proposes only. Don't use it to acually keep track of appointments. Don't.

Inquires can be sent to ciaran.curley.11.11@gmail.com. Looking for work, so will also accept employment offers within Ireland.
